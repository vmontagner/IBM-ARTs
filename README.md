# IBM-ARTs
Repository with the files created and generated during Vinicius Montagner's master's project, under the guidance of Danilo G. Muniz, in the Graduate Program in Ecology, University of SÃ£o Paulo. The project is entitled "Interaction between pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection and its influence on the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics". In summary, I created an individual-based model (IBM) and sought to understand how pre- and post-copulatory stages of sexual selection, and the interaction between the stages, influence the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics. The reproductive tactics that I am simulating are those conditional tactics, which present an interaction between a genetic factor and an environmental clue.

# IBM-ARTs
Repository with the files created and generated during Vinicius Montagner's master's project, under the guidance of Danilo G. Muniz, in the Graduate Program in Ecology, University of SÃ£o Paulo. The project is entitled "Interaction between pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection and its influence on the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics". In summary, I created an individual-based model (IBM) and sought to understand how pre- and post-copulatory stages of sexual selection, and the interaction between the stages, influence the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics. The reproductive tactics that I am simulating are those conditional tactics, which present an interaction between a genetic factor and an environmental clue.

In the "csv" and "fitness" folders are the files generated over the simulations. Each file present in "csv" presents all the response variables in each generation. Each file in "fitness" presents fitness data for each individual in generation 400 of simulation x.

In the "Simulation" folder are the .r codes needed to perform the simulations from the beginning.

In the folder "PRCC" there is the code that calculates the PRCC values presented in the results table of the manuscript.
